# responsive-using-foundation
In this project, I’ll try out Zurb's Foundation framework by building a site – [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/).

The purpose of this project is to build a responsive mobile-first design using [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) framework and to compare it with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), in wich I have some experience.
